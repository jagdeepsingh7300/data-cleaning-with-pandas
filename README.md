# data-cleaning-with-pandas 
Project Overview
In this notebook, I performed several cleaning tasks, including:
Removing unwanted characters (phone numbers, addresses, etc.)
Splitting complex text fields into multiple columns
Handling missing values
Dropping unwanted rows based on conditions
Standardizing column formats
Applying regex patterns for data cleaning
Improving dataset readability and consistency


This project helped me practice Pandas operations, regex, and basic data preprocessing, which are essential skills for Data Engineering.
